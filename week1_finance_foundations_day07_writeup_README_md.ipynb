        "## 1. Problem Overview\n",
        "Financial institutions must assess loan applications carefully to minimize default risk while maintaining fairness.\n",
        "This project explores how data science can support loan approval decisions using historical applicant data.\n",

        "## 2. Dataset Description\n",
        "The dataset contains applicant-level financial and demographic information, including:\n",
        "- Applicant and co-applicant income\n",
        "- Loan amount and loan term\n",
        "- Credit history\n",
        "- Loan approval status\n",

        "- Credit history strongly correlates with loan approval\n",
        "- Income alone does not determine approval\n",
        "- Some low-income applicants are approved, suggesting multi-factor decision rules\n",
